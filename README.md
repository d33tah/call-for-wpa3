Agree
===

I agree there needs to be a change.  I remember many many years ago when I would test my wireless network with WEP encryption and it would take hours and hours to finally get the key.  Years later it took less than 3 minutes.  WPA/WPA2 came out and the hardware that existed used to only get 100-300 Keys tested per second which every "tester" knew could take forever.  Rainbow tables showed up and since wireless networks were still considered "new" to most individuals they really didn't know how to secure it.  They would leave the names of the network the same and choose easy passwords.  Well with rainbow tables this made it simple, same network name = search top passwords in seconds.  Many networks were talked about being accessed in security forums.  These days with GPU's, WPA/2 has become easier to "test".  Gamers buy 2-4 graphics cards all the time building their massive gaming rigs.  The latest GTX 1080 can do almost 400 kH/s, now imaging 4 of those or like many Hashcat enthusiasts they put 8 of them in there.

My Attempt

Years ago I created a twitter account just to contact the WIFI ALLIANCE and give them my suggestion.  I wrote it on stack exchange and linked it in the twitter comment.  I also tried to email them.  I got a response and basically it was pay the membership fee.

My Idea years ago
===
I'd like to start off saying that I am in no way a securty expert and if a security expert can prove this as a waste of time, then please do. Also if any of this is wrong please correct it, its been a while since I had this thought and wrote it again.

*Current Formula*
Key = PBKDF2(HMAC−SHA1, passphrase, ssid, 4096, 256)

The formula takes the passphrase and the network name(SSID) and iterates it 4096 times with HMAC-SHA1 to get the 256bit key.  As you can see the only unique part of the formula would be the SSID (besides what were looking for...the password).  This is how Rainbow tables could be created for the most common SSID's.  "Testers" worked on them for years.  These days the semi-tech knows to change this to something unique, but there are still MANY that I see on my phone (when it searches for hotspots) that are the same basic manufacture ones.

I read a basic way that it works with the 4 way handshake.  The client sends a message to the Router saying I want to connect.  The router then sends a random message that is encrypted with the KEY.  The client then repeats that message back so the router knows you have the key and then the router allows the connections *Probably really dumbing this down and may have forgot something, but basic principle.*  Now one thing not mentioned here is that both the client and the Router have been sending very important information which includes the mac addresses of each other.

*My Formula*
--first part--
Key = PBKDF2(HMAC−SHA256/3, passphrase (at least 14 characters) + Router Mac, ssid + router mac, 100,000, 256)

The formula above increases the iterations (can be modified as hardware allows).  It also makes rainbow tables almost useless by adding the Routers unique mac address to the formula with the passphrase and the ssid. It also wants a passphrase that is 14 characters in length and changes the HMAC to SHA2/3

--Second Part--
Key = PBKDF2(HMAC−SHA256/3, passphrase (at least 14 characters) + Router Mac, ssid + router mac + client mac, ITERATIONS, 256)

Once the client has proven that it knows the password with the first formula (or even from the start), the router will reply with a random number between lets say 10000- 25000 (can be modified as hardware allows).  THe client will then fill this number in and reply back to the router showing again that it has the password and understands that now it will use the new number of iterations.    

This can expire over time/set time/never.  If the router gets reset/client, then when the client attempts to connect, it will default to the original formula and start the process over.  

--Thoughts---

Just using the first formula makes it harder for "testers".  Implementing the second one could make it even harder for someone to "test" the router, not knowing what iterations are needed for the formula.

There's alot more ideas, but putting them into practice would be complicated i'm sure.  One idea is to have the router/client incorporate an actual chip/hardware that saves a table of clients and save another secret random passphrase that was established after a successfull first connection.  From that moment on the responses would end/begin with that random data to show its coming from the original client, not a spoofed mac.  This table would exist even if the firmware was updated/etc.  If it was lost/reset the user could reconnect the clients kinda like WPS/bluetooth with a verification that it is the client.  The router would ignore all other attempts by the mac address that didn't have the random data..so if an attacker wanted to send a dEAUTH command the router would ignore it unless it came from the client who is sending the proper data.  Again this could be looked at/tinkered with.

Call for WPA3 - what's wrong with WPA2 security and how to fix it
===

Some time ago, I started learning how modern Wi-Fi networks are built. As a security enthusiast, I was particularly interested in how their safety mechanisms can be broken and strengthened. In this post, I'm going to list problems that can't easily be solved yet and what their solutions could be if we created a new wireless network security protocol. NOTE: this post is not meant for tech-savvy people only - in every paragraph I'm going to try to explain the problem in layman's terms.

What's WPA2?
===

WPA2 is the latest network protocol that is supposed to secure your network connection from (possibly malicious) interference. It describes how your Wi-Fi access point should authenticate you in order to guard who can and who cannot enter your network. It was announced in 2004 in order to fix previous version of the protocol which became so insecure that it was pretty much the equivalent of having no protection at all.

What's wrong with WPA2?
===

Anyone can disconnect you
---

Here's a fun fact: if I'm within the range of your network, I can kick you out of it. I don't need a password or any special equipment: pretty much any average laptop with a tiny program installed is going to let me send a so-called DEAUTH packet to your AP and say something like "hey, just kick this person out of the network". If you're under this attack, which is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_deauthentication_attack">DEAUTH attack</a>, it's going to look to you as if your network connection was weak or broken. You will be able to connect back and the attacker can then send the annoying signal again and again as much as they want. There are no safeguards as of today (at least none that I know of) and since one can do it without sending a lot of information into the network, it's not trivial to detect and block the source of the disruption. Another fun fact: some hotels will try to do this kind of attack on you if you're not using their wireless network, just to force you to pay.

**How could this be solved?** That's pretty simple: don't accept DEAUTH packets from strangers. As long as one can't prove that they're a member of the network, they shouldn't be able to disconnect from it. After all, no session is established yet, so the command wouldn't really make much sense.  This is also known as [802.11w](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11w-2009).

The password can be cracked offline
---

Apart from being able to disconnect you as many times as they want, the attacker can also sniff your WiFi password if they manage to observe you connecting to the network. It's going to be encrypted though, but it shouldn't comfort you much; once the so-called WiFi handshake was sniffed, <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/202441/your-wi-fi%E2%80%99s-wpa2-encryption-can-be-cracked-offline-here%E2%80%99s-how/">the attacker can just walk home and crack the password</a> without further access to your network. This means that they can easily try out millions of passwords without you knowing anything. At this rate, any simple password can be cracked in minutes and the more resistant ones - overnight. Think about it when choosing your WiFi password and read up on <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2014/02/choosing_a_secure_pa.html">how to pick one that takes ages to brute-force</a>.

**How could this be solved?** Apart from picking a good password (or <a href="http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html">a passphrase</a>), there are solutions that could help everyone. First of all, password checking should be made more computationally expensive. In other words, we should make it more difficult to check a password. On most networks, it wouldn't hurt if logging into the network for the first time took five more seconds and on a properly designed authentication standard, it would mean that the attacker would have to spend five seconds while trying out every single password. That means that instead of testing millions of passwords per second, testing million passwords would take <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=five+million+seconds">almost two months</a>. With this amount of effort, this would be made both uneconomic to break passwords and future safe (at least for some time). This can be achieved using key derivation functions like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2">PBKDF2</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt">Scrypt</a>. Also, minimum password length requirements could be increased from 8 to 12 characters, this would make a thousand times more difficult to crack the simplest numeric password allowed.

Another thing that could be done to prevent the attacker from cracking the password is to make it impossible break them without being within the Access Point's range. Contemporary cryptography provides tools that could solve this problem. Another benefit would be that we could clearly see the attacker trying all the possible passwords, which could serve as a warning to all the users. By the way, introducing some way for the AP to tell you "the network is being under attack!" is another thing that could be useful when securing your network.

Once you know the password, you can sniff traffic and spoof anyone
---

That's not all yet! Once the attacker cracked your password, them using your network should be least worrying to you. Anyone that is connected to the network can effectively <a href="http://security.stackexchange.com/a/8593/15648">read everyone's traffic and change it as they please</a>. Luckily this excludes HTTPS websites (at least to some degree), but it's still a huge problem when anyone can impersonate you and <a href="https://moxie.org/software/sslstrip/">redirect your encrypted bank connection to an unencrypted one</a>.

**How could this be solved?** The problem exists because WPA2 has a fatal cryptographic flaw which allows the derivation of the master key which is shared across all connected peers. This could be decided because of performance reasons, but I'm pretty sure that our computers and APs speeded up quite a lot since 2004 and even back then sacrificing security for performance (without a simple way to opt out) was a pretty bad idea. This problem could be solved by using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange">Diffie–Hellman key exchange (DH)</a>.

From the user's perspective, unless you really know what you're doing, I advise you not to browse any sensitive websites (especially banking) over wireless and check in your AP's manual how to separate your Wi-Fi network from the wired one.


It won't let you secure a passwordless network (and the alternative is terrible).
---

One more thing I'd expect from a secure Wi-Fi protocol is to make "open" Wi-Fi networks more secure. As of today, the only choice is between a semi-secure wireless network and one that isn't protected by a password. If you're for example running a cafe and would like to attract more customers with serving access to the internet for free, you either have to make users enter a long password (which would protect them from attackers that don't know the password) **or** set up a completely unprotected network so that customers don't need to enter the password. This isn't good choice.

**How could this be solved?** The new WPA security standard could support the "passwordless" mode that requires no authentication, but keeps an encrypted channel of communication so that the anonymous user can identify himself and make traffic only readable by the access point. In other words, we need something that works in a way similar to SSL/TLS, but connection-wide: require no authentication, but protect the user from having their traffic sniffed or spoofed in any way.

Silly "terms of service" in your cafe can break your applications and expose you to risk
---

Ever seen this "please accept terms of service" or a login screen when trying to open a website after connecting to a Wi-Fi network? Or even worse, did you ever get this "this connection is not trusted" screen, clicked "continue anyway" and see this kind of "welcome" website? Well, this is what terrible engineering looks like when there are no proper tools to solve a problem. Back in the time when Wi-Fi was invented, nobody thought that the network would have any need to contact you regarding terms of service or anything like this. Because of that, engineers decided that it's a good idea to capture the user's traffic and send them a note. Some of the Access Points will even try to perform the Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attack to make you see this screen if you're trying to visit an encrypted website. From the psychological aspect of security, this is completely unacceptable: if you're making users used to the fact that an access point can modify the displayed website, they're losing one of the ways to tell whether they're under attack. The attacker can have an easier way to perform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering">social engineering</a> on a target, which obviously is bad.

**How could this be solved?** Introduce a way for APs to send messages to the user and let them know that without the acceptable of terms of service, they can't browse the internet. The same channel could be used to notify the user that the network is under attack. I expect that this will also be abused by people trying to smuggle advertisements over this channel, so the user should have a way to mute those notifications on a per-network basis. This channel could be used also to inform the Client if the network has internet access (telling the Client to keep cellular data active while on this network) and to inform if the network is a mobile hotspot with metered bandwidth limitations (telling the Client to treat this network as a cellular data connection).

What else?
---

I don't really know **all** of WPA2 features and I'm pretty sure that there are more things that are broken about WPA2 that could be fixed. If you know any, I invite you to open a pull request on Github and let me know about it.

OK, how could we fix things for everyone?
===

Option one: getting Wi-Fi alliance to fix their protocol
---

I believe that the first step should be to list the things that are broken about WPA2 and ask <a href="https://wi-fi.org">Wi-Fi alliance</a> to fix those. Here's what they told me when I contacted them:

> Thank you for contacting Wi-Fi Alliance.
> 
> In regards to your question about work on security developments, there is a member task group that is working to advance Wi-Fi security enhancements. You can find all the current work groups on the Wi-Fi Alliance website at http://www.wi-fi.org/who-we-are/current-work-areas.
> 
> In order to participate in discussion and work groups, companies must become a member of Wi-Fi Alliance.
> 
> Best Regards,
> Wi-Fi Alliance Staff
> ref:_00D407XSp._50033vj08w:ref

Option two: hack up unofficial WPA3 without the help of Wi-Fi alliance
---

Free Software community has a wide range of networking software that enables manipulation of Wi-Fi traffic. While some of it can be used for nefarious purposes, we could as well use it to sketch up a prototype of WPA3 and push for it to get adopted. If you're interested, I encourage you to contact the discussion boards for projects related to Wi-Fi manipulation and see if they're interested in this. Some of the projects that are related include: ScaPy, WPA supplicant, OpenWRT. There's definitely more of them so if you know them, let me know!
